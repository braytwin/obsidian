────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

What the App Offers ・

A free creating Account System, with a profile with Username, Nickname, Profile Picture, Bio, Pronouns, Profile/PFP Effects (With Premium)
Users can create their own "Vaults," which are similar to Discord Servers, but with a Different Name. These Vaults have their own Vault Image for their icon, and a Vault Theme they can select from. Here are the Vault Themes they have to choose from: Basic Vault, Gaming Vault, Emoji Vault, Movie Vault, Pet Vault, Voice Chat Vault, Active Vault, and Build your own Vault. You can only build 5 Vaults on each account.  
On the Vaults, you can add your own Channels with their own names, and you can add a Channel Template with like symbols in front of the Channel Name, like so: (・ Channel Name)
You can create your own Custom Rules for the Vault and the roles in Vault Settings. You can also add your own custom emojis. To add 5 more slots of 10 emojis, you need ObsidianCore. As a Basic Member, you have 2 slots, so you can upload a total of 10 custom emojis to these slots.
You can also do Video Calls, Voice Messages, Send Reactions, Send Emojis (Custom Emojis with ObsidianCore (Premium), Send GIFS, Send ObsidianCore Gifts, Send Items and Emotes (Emotes are Emoji GIFS that the user sends to someone, and music or effects start playing on their screen based on what Emote they sent. The items are stuff to gift to them, like a StreakSaver, XP Giver, etc.
You can also Add Users and Send Friend Requests and Message Requests. There are also ObsidianRooms. You can create up to 2 Private Rooms with a Room Code that you can join in real-time. You can join the 5 Main Rooms: The Main Room, VIP Room, Core Room, School Room, and Gaming Room.

The Theme Of Obsidian ・

The UI of Obsidian is Sleek, Simple, Clean, Minimal, and Very Simple UI. The colors are smooth gradients of Black, White, and Dark Grey. With some accents of white.
The particles are smooth, right-side moving particles moving to the right with a gradient black and dark grey background.
The font for the Big Titles is 'League Spartan' while the small texts and headers are 'Inter Bold'.
The icons used for the Sidebar are 'Font Awesome Icons' and don't use emojis or slanted Font Awesome icons. And add smooth animations and effects to everything.

The Rundown of Obsidian ・

When you open the app, Obsidian will greet you with its homepage for "index.html". It's like the Discord Homepage, it has the 'League Spartan' Font for the "Obsidian" title with the particles in the back like I told you before. Then there is a button that says "Login" or "Sign Up." If you scroll down on the homepage, it has what the App has to offer, like Round Squares with the Font Awesome icon and the title of what it offers, then the description, and when you hover over it, it has a shadow. There is a smooth animation for the icon, etc. When you press login or sign up, it takes you to the /login.html page, which is the login screen, but you can press register if you don't have an account. Once you press register, you put your email, password, and then you go to the login screen and log in with that. Then you're on the /app.html. It auto-greets you and says, "Hey! Welcome to Obsidian! To get started, go to your profile!" with a button that takes you directly to your profile. Each account has its own profile and account, complete with its own servers. Then it has a button that says "Take me to my Profile!" Then it takes you to your profile, and here are all the settings on your profile. It's built like Discord's, and it has the side panel with the Account, Profile, Theme (With 4 Main Themes, White/Midnight/Black/Default), Devices (Can see your IP and where you logged in, and what device), and just a bunch of normal settings, etc. On the Account one, you can change your email, username, password, email, and log out or delete the account. On the profile settings, you can change your Profile Picture, Nickname, Bio, Pronouns, Banner, etc. With ObsidianCore, you can change your Profile Picture Frame, like it's an animated 3D Frame for the PFP, and you can change the Profile Collage, and that's like ProfileCollage color and animation, that's all with ObsidianCore. In the Obisidian App, at the bottom, you see a line with an "Add Vault" button and a "Discovery" button, and all your vaults that you are in go in there. And above the Vault List (near the bottom), above that is the Daily Feed with Announcements, and round squares and dates and names and pictures for each announcement, etc. It also has the real-time of what the user's time is, and the time moving animation is just a 3d flipping animation for the time when it changes, like seconds, minutes, etc. It also has your notifications, latest friend requests, and more stuff for the homepage. For the Vault's you can add roles, bots, all that stuff, etc. Let's move the Vault List to be on the left-hand side, going down, Kind of like Discord. You can add custom emojis and stickers to the vault. The messaging system is like Discord's. It has the message bar, with some text like: Message in "The Channel name or the User's Name", and then on the right side of the message board is the "Elements", which has the "Emoji Selection", "GIF Keyboard," "Sticker Selection", and "Gift User" which will cost money and be used with 'Stripe Payments' The emoji keyboard will be 'API'd' from "https://emoji-api.com/" and the GIF Keyboard will be from here: "https://tenor.com/developer/dashboard" and the "Sticker Selection" will be from "https://dashboard.stipop.io/auth/sign-up" and that' all! There is a secret called "The X," and you have to press these 10 keys on your keyboard, and you get "ObsidianX." It allows you to get custom backgrounds, ObsidianCore, and more. Only friends can get it. There is also a shop where you can get "Obsidian Shards" that you can pay for money, like "500 Shards for $2.99", "1000 Shards for $5.99", "5000 Shards for $10.99", "10,000 Shards for $20.99", and lastly, "50,000 Shards for $60.99" And in the shop, you can buy stuff instead of having Core. You can buy CoreBasic for $2.99 for 1 Month, which has only custom emojis and the badge on your profile. Normal Core is $9.99 for 1 Month, and it has all the perks. Here is the Release Items for the Shop: (I will link the GIF or PNG of the Animations Below) Profile Animations: "Black Flames", "Rainbow Flow", "Cute Hearts", "It's Showtime!", "Y2K Clouds," and here are the packs/bundles. "Showgirl Style Pack" about Taylor Swift's New Album: 'The Life of a Showgirl', These Colors will be a Shiny Green and Orange. Here is the "Showgirl Style Pack", "Showgirl Stars: Avatar Animation", "Books and Poetry: Avatar Animation", "Showgirl Queen: Profile Animation", "Showgirl Life: Banner", and that's the Showgirl pack. Make the other packs yourself. Make the other shop banner, profile animations, avatar animstions yourself.

Here are some more ideas and stuff that I need:

1. The Obsidian AI Assistant: "Oracle" ・
You mentioned an AI Assistant, which is a fantastic idea. Let's give it a name and some specific functions:
@Oracle Catch-Up: In a busy channel, a user can type @Oracle catch me up, and the AI will provide a brief, bullet-pointed summary of the last 50 or 100 messages.
Magic Reply: Based on the last few messages in a conversation, Oracle can suggest 2-3 short, context-aware replies for the user to send with one click.
Image Scribe: If a user posts an image without a description, Oracle can automatically generate alt-text for accessibility or a brief caption describing the image's content.
Tone Analysis (ObsidianCore Perk): Before sending a message, a Core subscriber can have Oracle analyze its tone (e.g., "Friendly," "Formal," "Urgent") to help avoid miscommunication.

2. Advanced Vault Customization: "Vault Blueprints" ・
Instead of just themes, "Vault Blueprints" are pre-packaged templates that instantly set up a Vault for a specific purpose.
Blueprint: "Streamer Community"
Pre-made Channels: #announcements, #live-now, #general-chat, #clips-and-highlights, #suggestions, and private #mod-chat.
Pre-configured Roles: Streamer (Owner), Moderator, VIP, Subscriber, Member.
Integrated Bots: A pre-installed bot that automatically posts in #live-now when the streamer starts their broadcast on Twitch or YouTube.

Blueprint: "Study Group"
Pre-made Channels: #course-materials, #q-and-a, #homework-help, #study-session-vc.
Integrated Bots: A bot with commands for setting Pomodoro timers (/pomodoro 25) and creating flashcards.

Blueprint: "Indie Dev Team"
Pre-made Channels: #design, #programming, #art-assets, #bug-reports, #build-updates.
Integrated Bots: A bot that connects to GitHub to post updates on new code commits and issues.

3. Enhanced Presence & Status ・
Go beyond the basic online/offline indicators.
Live Activity Status: Automatically show what game a user is playing, what song they're listening to on Spotify, or what program they're using (e.g., "Designing in Figma").
Timed Statuses: Set a custom status that automatically clears after a set amount of time. (e.g., "In a meeting" - Clears in 1 hour).
Vault-Specific Statuses (ObsidianCore Perk): Users can set a different status for each Vault they are in. They might be "Working on the project" in their dev team Vault but "Looking to play" in their gaming Vault.

More Items for the Obsidian Shop
Here are new categories and packs to expand the shop's offerings.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. "Focus Modes" Notification System
Go beyond simple on/off switches. Users can create and schedule custom notification profiles.
Create Profiles: A user can create modes like "Work," "Gaming," "Studying," or "Sleeping."
Granular Rules: For each mode, you can set specific rules:
In "Work" mode: Mute all Vaults except for [Work Project Vault]. Only allow DM notifications from [Coworkers List].
In "Gaming" mode: Mute all notifications except for DMs and @mentions from [Gaming Friends List] in the [Gaming Vault]. Display non-intrusive pop-ups for voice call invites.
In "Studying" mode: Mute everything except for @mentions in [Study Group Vault]. Send a summary of missed messages every hour instead of real-time pings.
Scheduling & Automation: Automatically switch to "Work" mode from 9 AM to 5 PM on weekdays or switch to "Gaming" mode whenever a game is launched.

2. Advanced Privacy Controls: "The Cloak"
Granular Activity Status: You can control who sees your activity on a per-Vault or per-user basis. Appear offline in the "Work Vault" while still showing you're playing a game to your friends in the "Gaming Vault."
DM Security Tiers:
Tier 1 (Open): Anyone can DM you.
Tier 2 (Filtered): DMs from non-friends go to a "Message Requests" folder and cannot send attachments until you accept.
Tier 3 (Locked): Only users you have whitelisted can send you a DM. Everyone else gets an automated message: "This user is not accepting DMs at this time."
Data Visibility: A clear, easy-to-read dashboard showing exactly what data Obsidian collects and options to opt out of non-essential tracking.

3. Total Interface Customization
Modular UI: Allow users to drag-and-drop elements of the UI. Don't like the Daily Feed on the homepage? Replace it with a "Favorite Channels" widget or a "Pinned DMs" widget.
Custom Fonts & CSS (ObsidianCore Perk): For advanced users, allow them to upload their own fonts or apply custom CSS snippets to safely reskin their entire app experience. Obsidian would provide a "CSS Validator" to ensure snippets don't break the app or compromise security.
Game-Changing Features (Things Discord Doesn't Have)
These are the "killer apps" for Obsidian.

1. "The Canvas": A Real-Time Collaborative Whiteboard Channel
This isn't a separate feature; it's a new type of channel within a Vault.
Functionality: When you open a Canvas channel, you see a shared, infinite whiteboard instead of a chat log.
What you can do:
Drag & Drop Anything: Drop in images, links, text boxes, and video clips directly onto the Canvas.
Live Drawing & Annotations: Users can draw, highlight, and type on the Canvas simultaneously. See your friends' cursors moving in real time.
Sticky Notes & To-Do Lists: Add virtual sticky notes for brainstorming or create shared to-do lists that people can check off.
Polls & Voting: Place an interactive poll directly on the Canvas for instant group decisions.
Use Cases: Perfect for planning a gaming strategy, collaborating on a school project, brainstorming a story, or creating a mood board. It's a visual, interactive alternative to a text channel.

2. "Ambiance AI" for Voice Channels
Allows users to add shared, ambient background soundscapes to their voice calls.
Library of Sounds: Choose from a curated list of high-quality ambient tracks: Rainy Night, Cozy Cafe, Sci-Fi Starship Bridge, Crackling Fireplace, Forest Sounds.
Shared Experience: Everyone in the channel hears the same ambiance, making the call feel more immersive and less sterile. The volume can be adjusted by each user individually.
Use Cases: Great for D&D sessions (a Fantasy Tavern ambiance), study groups (Calm Library ambiance), or just chilling with friends (Lofi Beats ambiance).

3. Native, Integrated Scheduling & Events
No more relying on third-party bots.
Event Creation: A dedicated "Events" tab within each Vault. Create an event with a title, description, date, time, and an optional image.
RSVP System: Members can RSVP with "Going," "Maybe," or "Not Going." The event creator can see a list of attendees.
Automated Reminders: Obsidian automatically DMs reminders to all "Going" members an hour before the event starts.
Recurring Events: Set up weekly raid nights or monthly movie nights that auto-populate in the calendar.
Obsidian Labs (Features Coming Soon)
This is a special settings tab where users can opt in to test experimental new features and provide feedback.

Project: "Oracle Co-Pilot" for Vaults (Alpha)
An AI moderator that can be trained by Vault admins. It can learn the Vault's rules and automatically delete spam, welcome new members with a custom message, and even answer basic questions that are frequently asked.

Project: "Instant Replay" (Beta)
For voice channels, this feature allows users to instantly clip and share the last 30 seconds of conversation, just like in video games. Perfect for capturing hilarious moments without having to record the entire call.

Project: "AR Emotes" (Concept)
Using your phone's camera, you'll be able to project 3D animated versions of your favorite emotes into the real world.

Core Messaging APIs
These are the APIs you specifically mentioned for the chat's core functionality.

Emoji Keyboard
API Provider: Emoji API
Link: https://emoji-api.com/
What it's for: This API provides a simple way to fetch a comprehensive and up-to-date list of all available emojis, organized by category. You'll use this to populate the emoji selection menu in your chat bar.

GIF Keyboard
API Provider: Tenor
Link: https://developers.google.com/tenor/
API Key: AIzaSyDB3EY0PtpvyeIAsnRYg-mzP2sG4qUxwMg
What it's for: The Tenor API is the industry standard for integrating a GIF search engine. It allows your users to search for trending GIFs, search by keyword, and share them directly within the Obsidian app.

Sticker Selection
API Provider: Stipop
Link: https://developers.stipop.io/
What it's for: The Stipop API gives you access to a massive library of stickers. You can integrate their sticker search and marketplace directly into your app, allowing users to find and send stickers in their chats.

Monetization & Payments
This is for handling all the in-app purchases like ObsidianCore subscriptions and Shards.
Payments
API Provider: Stripe
Link: https://stripe.com/docs/api
Status: Coming Soon
What it's for: Stripe is a complete payment processing platform. Its API is used to securely handle credit card payments, manage recurring subscriptions (like for ObsidianCore), and process one-time purchases (like for Shard bundles).

Rich Presence & Integrations
These APIs are for showing live activity statuses and integrating with other platforms for the "Vault Blueprints."
Music Activity (Spotify)
API Provider: Spotify
Link: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/
Client ID: 7a03664eaf874ea28a15e3e14d6b9047
Client Secret: 6cdc599f146f436d85b6e136737298d1
What it's for: The Spotify Web API allows you to connect a user's Spotify account to Obsidian. You can use it to get information about what song they are currently listening to and display it on their profile as a live status.

Game Activity (Rich Presence)
This is more complex as there is no single API for all games. This functionality is typically achieved through a Software Development Kit (SDK) that game developers can integrate.
Reference Link: https://discord.com/developers/docs/game-sdk/sdk-starter-guide
How it works: You would create your own Obsidian GameBridge SDK. Game developers would then add this SDK to their games. When a user plays that game, the SDK communicates with the Obsidian app to update their status with details like what they're doing in the game, how long they've been playing, etc.

Streamer Notifications (Twitch & YouTube)
API Provider: Twitch
Link: https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/
What it's for: The Twitch API lets you check the status of a streamer's channel. You can use it to see when a specific user goes live and then automatically post a notification in your "Streamer Community" Vault.
API Provider: YouTube
Link: https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs
What it's for: Similar to Twitch, the YouTube Data API lets you get information about channels and live streams. You'd use this to create notifications when a YouTuber starts a live broadcast.

Code Repository Updates (GitHub)
API Provider: GitHub
Link: https://docs.github.com/en/rest
What it's for: The GitHub REST API allows you to interact with code repositories. You can use its "webhooks" feature to get automatic notifications for events like new code commits or bug reports and then post those updates directly into a channel in your "Indie Dev Team" Vault.
